# C++ Learning Journey

This repository contains my progressive learning journey through C++ programming fundamentals. Each file demonstrates different concepts and programming techniques, starting from basic syntax and advancing to more complex topics.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Compilation
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

### Running Examples
Each file contains multiple examples (mostly commented out). To test different examples:
1. Uncomment the desired code section
2. Comment out other examples
3. Compile and run

## üìñ Learning Progression

This collection follows a logical learning path:

1. **Foundation** ‚Üí Basic syntax and program structure
2. **Data Handling** ‚Üí Variables, types, and operations
3. **Control Flow** ‚Üí Decisions and loops
4. **Problem Solving** ‚Üí Pattern recognition and implementation
5. **Modularity** ‚Üí Function creation and usage
6. **Number Systems** ‚Üí Binary operations and conversions
7. **Advanced Operations** ‚Üí Bitwise manipulation and memory concepts

## üîß Key Programming Concepts Learned

- **Memory Management**: Understanding data type sizes and memory allocation
- **Algorithm Design**: Step-by-step problem-solving approaches
- **Pattern Recognition**: Visual programming and nested loop structures
- **Mathematical Programming**: Implementing mathematical formulas in code
- **Bit Manipulation**: Low-level operations and number system conversions
- **Function Design**: Creating reusable, modular code components

## üìù Notes

- Code includes extensive comments for learning purposes
- Multiple examples are provided for each concept
- Examples can be uncommented individually for testing
- Focus on understanding logic flow and problem-solving approaches

## üéØ Next Steps

This foundational knowledge prepares for advanced C++ topics such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)
- Pointers and Dynamic Memory Management
- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O Operations
- Exception Handling
